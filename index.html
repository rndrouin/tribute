      Bar Harbor is a resort town on Mount Desert Island in 
      Hancock County, Maine, United States. As of the 2020 census, 
      its population is 5,089.[3] The town is home to the College
       of the Atlantic, Jackson Laboratory, and MDI Biological 
       Laboratory. During the summer and fall seasons, it is a 
       popular tourist destination.

Bar Harbor is also home to the largest parts of Acadia National 
Park, including Cadillac Mountain, the highest point within 25

State Route 3, by air at Hancock County Bar Harbor Airport, and
